# AI Agent Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for AI agents working with this codebase.

## Product and security boundary

Loam is a public, static, mobile-first PWA whose Markdown graph is provided by a `GraphStore`. Preserve both supported stores:

- a user-selected local folder through the File System Access API;
- one private GitHub repository connected at runtime with a fine-grained PAT.

UI code must consume the graph-store capability and must not read a raw token or call GitHub directly. Keep session-only credentials as the default. Persistent credentials require the standard disclosure and explicit acknowledgement. Never put a PAT or private note content in source, URLs, logs, build output, telemetry, Actions configuration, or service-worker caches. GitHub writes must include the expected file revision and surface conflicts instead of silently overwriting.

The outliner, data integrity, daily capture, and mobile editing experience have priority over visual polish. See `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/ADR-002-private-github-graph.md` before changing persistence or credential behavior.

## Project Structure

This is a TypeScript monorepo using pnpm workspaces with the following packages:

- `packages/core` - Core business logic and shared utilities
- `packages/cli` - Command-line interface
- `packages/web` - Web application with REST API
- `packages/mcp` - Model Context Protocol server for AI agent integration

## Development Workflow

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint and format
pnpm lint
pnpm format
```

### Making Changes

1. **Understand the context**: Review related code and tests before making changes
2. **Make minimal changes**: Only modify what's necessary to address the issue
3. **Follow patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing code style and patterns
4. **Write tests**: Add or update tests for your changes
5. **Build and test**: Run `pnpm build && pnpm test` to verify your changes
6. **Lint and format**: Run `pnpm lint` to ensure code quality

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode, avoid `any` when possible
- **Formatting**: Biome handles formatting automatically
- **Imports**: Use ES modules (`import/export`)
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/types
- **Error handling**: Use try/catch with meaningful error messages
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Package Dependencies

- **Core**: Should have minimal dependencies and be framework-agnostic
- **CLI**: Can depend on Core and command-line libraries (e.g., commander)
- **Web**: Can depend on Core and web frameworks (e.g., Express, React/Preact)
- **MCP**: Can depend on Core and MCP SDK

## Testing

- Use Vitest for unit tests
- Test files go in `test/` directory within each package
- Run tests with `pnpm test` (all packages) or `cd packages/[name] && pnpm test` (single package)
- Aim for good coverage of business logic and edge cases

## Building and Bundling

- TypeScript compilation: `pnpm build` (uses `tsc -b`)
- CLI bundling: Uses Rolldown for single-file executable
- Web bundling: Uses Vite for optimized production builds

## CI/CD

- **CI Pipeline**: Runs on all PRs and pushes to main
  - Lints, formats, builds, and tests all packages
  - Tests on Node.js 20.x and 22.x
  
- **Release Pipeline**: Triggers on version tags (`v*`)
  - Runs full test suite
  - Publishes CLI package to npm
  - Creates GitHub release

## Publishing

The release process uses semantic versioning:

1. Update version in `packages/cli/package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Commit changes
4. Create and push tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
5. CI automatically publishes to npm and creates GitHub release

## Common Tasks

### Adding a new feature
1. Implement in appropriate package (usually Core)
2. Add tests
3. Expose through CLI/Web/MCP as needed
4. Update documentation

### Fixing a bug
1. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the bug
3. Verify test passes
4. Check for similar issues elsewhere

### Updating dependencies
1. Use `pnpm update` to update within semver ranges
2. Test thoroughly after updates
3. Check for breaking changes in CHANGELOG of updated packages

## MCP Integration

The MCP package allows AI agents to interact with the application programmatically:

- Exposes tools/prompts via Model Context Protocol
- Runs as stdio server for local AI clients
- Shares configuration with CLI and Web packages

## Best Practices

- **Keep it simple**: Prefer simple, readable code over clever solutions
- **Performance**: Focus on correctness first, optimize only when needed
- **Security**: Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, avoid hardcoded secrets
- **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to understand and modify
- **Documentation**: Keep README and docs up to date with changes

## Getting Help

- Check existing tests for usage examples
- Review similar code in the codebase
- Consult package documentation in `docs/` directory
- Reference TypeScript and library documentation

## Notes for AI Agents

- Always run builds and tests before finalizing changes
- Check git status to ensure you're only committing relevant files
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
- Use the MCP package to integrate with AI workflows when appropriate
